# EPICC Design Decisions

A reference for architectural choices in the pipeline. Intended for contributors who need to understand why things are structured the way they are. Update this file when making major design decisions.

## Sample Sheet Design

### Sample_ID as the primary filesystem identifier

**Decision**: Each row in the sample sheet carries a user-assigned `Sample_ID` that serves as the filename stem for all per-replicate outputs (e.g. `final__WT_H3K9me2_rep1.bam`).

**Rationale**: The previous scheme constructed a compound name from six fixed columns (`data_type`, `line`, `tissue`, `sample_type`, `replicate`, `ref_genome`) and then deconstructed it with regex throughout the pipeline. This created fragility: any field containing a double-underscore or unexpected character could corrupt the name, and adding a new field required changing every rule that parsed the name. Using `Sample_ID` as an opaque token eliminates construction/parsing entirely. Wildcards in rule patterns bind directly to Sample_ID.

**Alternatives considered**: Keeping the compound name but centralizing its construction and parsing in one module. Rejected because it still requires all six fields to be present for every assay type (many fields are meaningless for RNA-seq or WGBS), and regex-based parsing is inherently fragile.

### Analysis-level names are derived, not stored

**Decision**: Merged-replicate (analysis-level) filenames are computed from group fields as `{Assay}__{levels_label}__{IP_target}__{Genome}`, with empty parts omitted so non-ChIP assays do not produce `____` in their paths.

**Rationale**: Analysis-level names need to be deterministic and human-readable, but they are fully derivable from sample metadata and should never be specified by the user. Deriving them keeps the sample sheet minimal while ensuring that replicates with identical metadata always resolve to the same analysis group.

**Alternatives considered**: Storing an explicit analysis group column. Rejected because it would require users to keep this column consistent with the other metadata fields, creating a validation burden and a new source of user error.

### `Levels` column for arbitrary experimental factors

**Decision**: Experimental conditions are encoded as comma-separated `factor:level` pairs in a single `Levels` column (e.g. `genotype:WT,tissue:root`). All samples in a run must have the same factor names and count.

**Rationale**: The old format had fixed `line` and `tissue` columns, which could not represent designs with a single factor, three or more factors, or factor names other than genotype and tissue. The `Levels` approach is schema-free while remaining machine-parseable. The factor names improve readability and allow the epicc-builder app to render dynamic per-factor columns for data entry.

**Alternatives considered**: Multiple fixed columns with a naming convention (e.g. `Factor1`, `Factor2`). Rejected because it shifts the schema negotiation problem from the pipeline to the user while providing no additional flexibility.

### Explicit control linking via a `Control` column

**Decision**: The `Control` column in each IP sample row must contain the `Sample_ID` of its corresponding input or whole-cell extract sample. Control chaining (a control pointing to another control) is forbidden.

**Rationale**: The previous pipeline assigned controls by matching `sample_type == "Input"` within the same group. This made it impossible to use different controls for different marks, or to use a whole-cell extract (WCE) with a name other than "Input". Explicit linking also means the relationship is self-documenting and survives any renaming of samples.

**Alternatives considered**: Keeping implicit matching by name convention. Rejected because it cannot handle multiple control types in the same experiment (Input, WCE, IgG) or different controls per mark.

### Peak type from Assay, not from IP_target name

**Decision**: `ChIP_broad` triggers broad peak calling (suitable for histone marks such as H3K9me2, H3K27me3); `ChIP_narrow` triggers narrow peak calling (suitable for transcription factors and H3K4me3). The IP_target name is not inspected to determine peak type.

**Rationale**: The previous approach pattern-matched `IP_target` strings against a regex list in the options file to assign peak type. This required users to maintain the regex list and could silently mis-classify marks not in the list. Encoding peak type in the Assay field makes the decision explicit at sample-sheet entry time and eliminates the regex config entirely.

**Alternatives considered**: Retaining the regex approach. Rejected because it is error-prone for novel marks and obscures the peak type setting from the sample sheet itself.

### No backward compatibility with old-format sheets

**Decision**: The new 9-column format (`Sample_ID`, `Assay`, `Genome`, `Levels`, `Replicate_ID`, `Read_files`, `Read_layout`, `IP_target`, `Control`) is a clean break. A migration script (`scripts/migrate_sample_sheet.py`) is provided; old-format detection was removed from the validation code.

**Rationale**: Maintaining dual-format support would require the validation and parsing code to branch on format detection, and the old format could not be reliably detected by column names (old sheets did not always include headers). The migration script makes the upgrade path explicit and testable.

## Conda Environment Strategy

### Consolidate to the minimum number of environments consistent with dependency conflicts

**Decision**: Eight conda environments were reduced to five by merging environments that shared an R/Bioconductor stack and had no package version conflicts.

| Env file | Serves |
|---|---|
| `epibutton.yaml` | base utilities, combined analysis, upset plots |
| `epibutton_chip.yaml` | ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq |
| `epibutton_rnaseq.yaml` | RNA-seq and small RNA-seq |
| `epibutton_mc.yaml` | bisulfite mC and direct methylation (dmC) |
| `epibutton_idr.yaml` | IDR only |

**Rationale**: The original eight environments contained significant redundancy: `r-base` installed three times, `bedtools` five times, `samtools` four times, and the common R visualization stack (dplyr, ggplot2, RColorBrewer) four or five times. The estimated total footprint was ~32 GB. Consolidating environments with compatible dependency trees reduces the installation footprint by roughly 3-4.5 GB and shortens initial setup time.

**Alternatives considered**: Merging all analysis tools into a single environment. Rejected because IDR requires `numpy <= 1.19` (due to deprecated `np.int`), which would conflict with numpy versions required by other tools. Merging ChIP tools into the base environment was also considered but rejected because bowtie2 + MACS2 + MaNorm represent a clean functional grouping with minimal overlap gain.

### IDR environment remains isolated

**Decision**: `epibutton_idr.yaml` is kept as a standalone environment pinned to `numpy <= 1.19`.

**Rationale**: The `idr` package depends on a numpy API (`np.int`) removed in numpy 1.20. Patching IDR upstream or using a compatibility shim was considered less portable than simply isolating the environment. Since IDR is run in a single rule, the isolation cost is low.

### `r-remotes::install_github` hack eliminated

**Decision**: The R upset plot scripts previously called `remotes::install_github("krassowski/complex-upset#212")` at runtime to work around a ComplexUpset incompatibility with ggplot2 4.0. This was removed; the conda-distributed `r-complexupset` package already incorporates the fix.

**Rationale**: Runtime installation of R packages inside a Snakemake rule is fragile (requires internet access from compute nodes, fails on air-gapped clusters, and makes the environment non-reproducible). The workaround was only necessary because the conda package lagged behind the fix; once the conda package was updated, the hack had no remaining purpose.

### Conda package tarball cleanup in SLURM profile

**Decision**: `conda-cleanup-pkgs: tarballs` is set in `profiles/slurm/config.yaml`. Orphaned environment cleanup (`--conda-cleanup-envs`) is documented as a manual maintenance step, not automated inside pipeline runs.

**Rationale**: Cleanup of orphaned environments changes which environments Snakemake considers valid and cannot be safely run concurrently with an active pipeline execution. Tarball cleanup is safe to automate because it only removes cached source archives after installation is complete.

---

## Performance and Disk Usage

### Configurable intermediate file retention with tiered presets

**Decision**: The `keep_intermediates` options key accepts four tiers: `none`, `standard`, `all`, and `custom`. The default is `standard`, which keeps per-replicate final BAMs and deletes trimmed FASTQs, merged BAMs, ATAC shifted BAMs, and bisulfite CX reports. A `maybe_temp()` helper in the Snakefile conditionally wraps output paths with Snakemake's `temp()` based on the resolved tier.

**Rationale**: Large intermediate files (trimmed FASTQs can reach 50 GB each; merged BAMs are also substantial) accumulate quickly in multi-sample experiments. Snakemake's `temp()` mechanism handles automatic deletion after downstream rules consume the file, but it was previously all-or-nothing. Users running on NFS-backed HPC storage have strong incentives to minimize disk footprint, while users doing exploratory analysis may want to retain intermediates for inspection. Tiered presets provide sensible defaults without requiring per-file configuration.

**Per-file defaults rationale**:
- Trimmed FASTQs deleted by default: re-trimming from raw data is fast; raw FASTQs are the authoritative inputs and are typically archived separately.
- Per-replicate final BAMs kept by default: these are frequently loaded in IGV or used for custom downstream analysis outside the pipeline.
- Merged BAMs and shifted ATAC BAMs deleted by default: consumed entirely by downstream bigwig/peak rules; large and easily regenerated.

**Alternatives considered**: A single boolean `keep_all_intermediates`. Rejected because it provides no middle ground — the most common need (keep BAMs, discard FASTQs) cannot be expressed.

### SAM-to-disk eliminated in ChIP and ATAC mapping

**Decision**: The `bowtie2_map` and `filter_chip` rules were merged into single piped shell commands. Bowtie2 writes to stdout, which is piped through `samtools view`, `samtools fixmate`, and `samtools sort` before producing the first BAM written to disk.

**Rationale**: SAM format is uncompressed and roughly 3-5x larger than an equivalent BAM. Writing a SAM to NFS storage and immediately reading it back for conversion is wasteful in both I/O and disk space. On high-latency NFS mounts, eliminating this round-trip provides a measurable speedup. The piped approach also reduces the number of intermediate BAMs from three to one.

**Alternatives considered**: Keeping separate rules but marking the SAM output as `temp()`. Rejected because the SAM file would still be written and read through NFS storage; the file simply gets deleted afterward. Piping avoids the I/O entirely.

### Merge rules pipe `samtools merge -u` into `samtools sort`

**Decision**: BAM merging rules for ChIP and RNA-seq pipe uncompressed merge output directly into sort, eliminating a temporary merged BAM on disk.

**Rationale**: Intermediate unsorted merged BAMs are large (sum of all replicate BAM sizes) and immediately consumed by sort. Writing them to disk provides no benefit and doubles the transient disk footprint of the merge operation.

### ENA-first SRA downloads with fasterq-dump fallback

**Decision**: SRA download rules (`get_fastq_pe`, `get_fastq_se`) first attempt to download pre-compressed `.fastq.gz` files from ENA via HTTPS, falling back to `fasterq-dump` only on failure. The ENA URL is constructed deterministically from the accession using a helper script (`workflow/scripts/ena_download.sh`). The fasterq-dump fallback uses `--temp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}"` for scratch storage, and PE mate compression runs in parallel.

**Rationale**: `fasterq-dump` writes uncompressed FASTQs (often 10-50 GB per mate) to disk, then `pigz` compresses them sequentially. ENA provides the same data pre-compressed, eliminating both the uncompressed intermediate and the compression step. This reduces peak disk usage by 2-3x and removes the I/O bottleneck of writing and reading large uncompressed files on NFS storage. The fallback ensures robustness: ENA may be unavailable, or accessions may not yet be mirrored (ENA mirrors lag SRA by hours to days). Using `$TMPDIR` for fasterq-dump scratch avoids filling shared `/tmp` and makes use of SLURM-allocated node-local storage. A dedicated `download` resource preset (8 threads) replaces the `heavy` preset (4 threads) for download rules, since both ENA downloads and pigz compression are I/O-bound and benefit from additional threads.

**Alternatives considered**: (1) Aspera (ascp) protocol for faster ENA transfers. Rejected because the IBM Aspera client is a non-trivial dependency that many HPC sites do not install. (2) ENA file-report API for URL/checksum validation. Rejected because URL construction from accession numbers is deterministic and well-documented; a failed curl cleanly signals fallback. (3) Always using fasterq-dump with `--include-technical` and piping directly to gzip. Rejected because fasterq-dump does not support stdout output, so the uncompressed intermediate cannot be avoided.

## Testing Strategy

### S. pombe as the primary integration test organism

**Decision**: A full multi-assay integration test uses publicly available S. pombe data (18 samples: ChIP-seq H3K9me2/me3/H3K4me3, RNA-seq, sRNA-seq) rather than a synthetic or downsampled A. thaliana dataset.

**Rationale**: S. pombe has a small genome (~12.5 Mb, 3 chromosomes) that makes full end-to-end pipeline runs practical on a laptop or single workstation in approximately 70 minutes. Using real published data from established labs (Kim et al. 2024 GSE156069, Ekwall lab GSE280066, Chang et al. 2017 GSE97746, Martienssen 2025 GSE278839) ensures the test exercises realistic data characteristics — mapping rates, peak shapes, differential expression patterns — rather than idealized synthetic data.

**Alternatives considered**: Subsetting an Arabidopsis dataset to a single chromosome. Rejected because chromosome-subset data introduces edge cases in reference genome indexing and annotation processing that do not reflect normal usage, and the Arabidopsis genome is larger enough that even a single chromosome produces a slower test than the complete pombe genome.

### Three-tier test structure: unit / dry-run / post-run

**Decision**: Tests are organized into unit tests (`tests/unit/`), integration dry-run tests (`tests/integration/test_pombe_dryrun.py`), and post-run validation tests (`tests/integration/test_pombe_postrun.py`). Post-run tests are marked `@slow` and auto-skip when no completed pipeline run is present.

**Rationale**: Dry-run tests (Snakemake DAG resolution without executing rules) catch the majority of configuration and wiring errors quickly without requiring compute resources or data downloads. Unit tests for `sample_sheet.py` functions catch logic errors in the parsing and validation layer without invoking Snakemake. Post-run tests verify output file existence, format integrity, and expected content after a real execution. Separating these tiers allows rapid iteration during development while preserving thorough validation for release.

### Rule command tests use synthetic SAM data

**Decision**: `tests/unit/test_rule_commands.py` constructs minimal synthetic SAM records in memory, runs the actual samtools pipeline commands extracted from rule shell blocks, and validates the BAM output.

**Rationale**: The most failure-prone rules after the SAM-to-disk elimination are the piped alignment rules (filter_chip_pe, filter_chip_se, filter_rna_se). These are difficult to test via dry-run because Snakemake cannot verify that a shell pipeline produces correctly sorted, filtered output. Testing the shell commands directly on synthetic data catches samtools flag errors, sort order issues, and pipe failures without requiring a real alignment run.

---

## Pipeline Architecture

### Sample-sheet logic centralized in `workflow/scripts/sample_sheet.py`

**Decision**: All functions for reading, validating, and querying sample metadata live in a single module (`sample_sheet.py`). The Snakefile imports from this module and calls a small set of well-defined functions rather than implementing parsing logic inline.

**Rationale**: Before the refactor, approximately 130 lines of sample-sheet parsing logic were embedded in the Snakefile, interleaved with rule definitions. This made the logic untestable in isolation and difficult to reason about. Centralizing it in an importable module enables unit testing of every parsing and validation function against in-memory DataFrames, independent of Snakemake.

### Modular rule files organized by assay type

**Decision**: Rules are split across eight `.smk` files, one per assay type, plus `environment_setup.smk` and `sample_download.smk`. The main Snakefile orchestrates inclusion and does no analysis work itself.

**Rationale**: A monolithic Snakefile becomes unnavigable as the number of assays grows. Per-assay rule files make it straightforward to locate rules, understand dependencies within an assay, and modify one assay's logic without risk of affecting others. The main Snakefile serves as an index and configuration point.

### Results directory organized by environment, not by assay

**Decision**: Output files go to `results/{env}/` where `env` is a coarser grouping than assay: `ChIP` serves both `ChIP_broad` and `ChIP_narrow`; `RNA` serves both `RNAseq` and `RAMPAGE`; `mC` serves `WGBS`, `EMseq`, and `dmC`.

**Rationale**: Assays within the same environment share tools, conda environments, and downstream analysis steps (peak calling for both broad and narrow ChIP, differential expression for both RNAseq and RAMPAGE). Grouping their outputs together simplifies combined analysis rules that aggregate across replicates or marks, and reduces the number of top-level directories a user needs to navigate.

### Checkpoint files for analysis-level rerun control

**Decision**: Analysis-level steps (peak calling, differential expression, DMR calling, combined plots) write empty sentinel files to `results/{env}/chkpts/`. Deleting a checkpoint file forces that analysis to rerun on the next pipeline invocation.

**Rationale**: Snakemake re-runs rules when inputs are newer than outputs. For analysis-level rules that aggregate across many samples, the inputs include all mapped BAMs, all peak files, and configuration parameters. Any upstream change — adding a new sample, adjusting a parameter — would otherwise trigger rerunning all downstream combined analysis. Checkpoint files decouple the re-run decision from file timestamps, giving users explicit control over which analyses to regenerate.

### epicc-builder as a self-contained, offline HTML5 application

**Decision**: The sample sheet and options file builder is a single HTML file (`tools/epicc-builder.html`) that can be opened directly in any modern browser without a server, internet connection, or Python environment. It is also deployed to GitHub Pages for users who prefer not to download the file.

**Rationale**: The original epicc-builder was a Streamlit web application that required a running Python server and became broken when the hosting environment changed. A self-contained HTML file has no runtime dependencies, works on air-gapped HPC login nodes, and can be committed to the repository and versioned alongside the pipeline code it describes. Tabulator (a JavaScript library that can be bundled into a single file) provides the interactive table functionality.

**Alternatives considered**: Rebuilding as a Streamlit or Flask app. Rejected because server-side apps require deployment infrastructure and introduce a runtime dependency that can fail independently of the pipeline. A CLI tool was also considered but rejected because tabular data entry is substantially more usable with a graphical interface.

---

## Configuration Naming

### "Options file" replaces "config file" for the pipeline YAML

**Decision**: The pipeline's main YAML configuration file was renamed from `config/config.yaml` to `config/epicc-options.yaml`, and all references to "config file" in documentation, code comments, and error messages were changed to "options file". Test config files were similarly renamed (e.g. `test_config_pombe.yaml` → `test_options_pombe.yaml`). The `config/` directory name, Snakemake's `--configfile` CLI flag, and profile config files (`profiles/slurm/config.yaml`) were left unchanged.

**Rationale**: "Config" is overloaded in the Snakemake ecosystem — the pipeline's main YAML, the SLURM profile YAML, and Snakemake's own configuration all use `config.yaml`. Calling the pipeline's YAML the "options file" clarifies that a complete run configuration is the composite of a sample sheet and an options file, and eliminates confusion with profile configs. The `epicc-` prefix in the filename makes the file self-identifying when it appears outside the repository context.

**Alternatives considered**: Renaming to `pipeline.yaml` or `settings.yaml`. Rejected because "options" better conveys user-tunable parameters, and the `epicc-` prefix ties it to the pipeline identity. Renaming the `config/` directory was considered but rejected because it would break Snakemake's default config path resolution and add unnecessary churn.

---

## Read Trimming

### fastp replaces cutadapt for adapter removal and quality trimming

**Decision**: Replace cutadapt with fastp across all assay types (ChIP, ATAC, RNA, sRNA, mC). The config structure was changed from tool-specific CLI strings (`trimming_quality: "-q 10 -m 20"`) to tool-agnostic keys (`quality_threshold`, `min_read_length`, `trim_front`). Standard Illumina adapters are set to `"auto"` for fastp auto-detection; non-standard adapters (NextFlex for sRNA, Nextera for ATAC) remain explicit. Trimming metrics output changed from cutadapt `.txt` to fastp `.json`, and HTML QC reports are now generated alongside.

**Rationale**: fastp is 2-5x faster than cutadapt, actively maintained (v1.0 released 2025), and provides automatic adapter detection for both SE and PE reads, built-in HTML/JSON QC reports, and polyG tail trimming. The tool-agnostic config keys decouple the configuration from any specific trimming tool, making future tool changes easier. fastp also applies default read-level quality filtering (discard reads with >40% bases below Q15) that cutadapt does not have, which is generally beneficial for catching truly low-quality reads. The `trim_front` key replaces the previously unimplemented manual Pico/EMseq override comment with a functional config option.

**Alternatives considered**: (1) skewer: unmaintained since ~2016, lacks QC reporting, would require a separate QC tool. (2) Keeping cutadapt with parallelized JSON output: cutadapt lacks built-in JSON metrics and auto-detection, so the benefit would be marginal. (3) trim_galore (a cutadapt wrapper): adds a dependency layer without significant speed improvement over cutadapt itself.

### Chromap as default aligner for ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq

**Decision**: Add Chromap as the default aligner for ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, with automatic fallback to bowtie2 for multi-mapping strategies. Options keys `chip_aligner`/`atac_aligner` select the aligner (default `"chromap"`); `chip_mapping_strategy`/`atac_mapping_strategy` replace the old `*_mapping_option` keys. When chromap is selected but the mapping strategy is `repeat` or `repeatall`, the pipeline automatically falls back to bowtie2 because chromap lacks bowtie2's `-k 100` multi-mapping mode. The MAPQ filter is extracted from the existing `bt2_mapping_strategy` config rather than hardcoded, making it aligner-agnostic. Stats rules auto-detect the metrics format (bowtie2 vs chromap stderr) for parsing.

**Rationale**: Chromap is a minimizer-based aligner specifically designed for ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data. Benchmarks show ~99.8% peak concordance with bowtie2 at 10-40x the speed. For large-genome organisms (e.g. maize at 2.2 Gb), this translates to substantial wall-clock savings on both local and cluster runs. Chromap is available on bioconda and actively maintained. The automatic fallback mechanism means users get the speed benefit by default while retaining bowtie2's multi-mapping capability when needed.

**Alternatives considered**: (1) Replacing bowtie2 entirely: rejected because chromap cannot replicate `-k 100` multi-mapping mode needed for repeat analysis. (2) Using chromap's BED output for ATAC (with `--preset atac` and Tn5 shift): rejected because downstream bigwig generation requires BAM input, and the existing `atac_shift_bam` rule (deeptools `alignmentSieve --ATACshift`) handles the shift correctly on BAM. (3) Adding chromap sensitivity tuning via `-e` (error threshold): deferred as a future enhancement since chromap has no preset sensitivity modes analogous to bowtie2's `--very-sensitive`.

### Genome config namespaced under `genomes:` with inlined species parameters

**Decision**: All reference genome blocks in `epicc-options.yaml` are namespaced under a `genomes:` key. Species-level parameters (`star_index`, `genomesize`, `ncbiID`, `genus`, `go_database`) that were previously in separate top-level species blocks are inlined into each genome entry. Rule files access genome config via `config["genomes"][ref_genome][field]`. A backward-compatibility shim in the Snakefile auto-migrates old bare-key format configs at startup with a deprecation warning. Startup validation (`check_genome_config()`) verifies that every genome referenced in the sample sheet has the required fields for its assay types.

**Rationale**: The previous layout placed genome blocks as bare top-level keys alongside unrelated config (e.g. `ColCEN:` at the same level as `quality_threshold:`). Species parameters required a fragile two-hop lookup pattern: `config[config[ref_genome]['species']][field]`. This was error-prone (a typo in the `species` field silently broke all downstream lookups), hard to validate at startup, and confusing for new users. Namespacing under `genomes:` makes the config self-documenting, inlining eliminates the indirection, and startup validation catches missing fields before rule execution.

**Alternatives considered**: (1) Keeping the two-level genome + species separation but namespacing both. Rejected because the indirection provided no real benefit — each genome already needed a unique species mapping, and most species blocks were used by exactly one genome. (2) Removing the `species` field entirely. Rejected because it still serves a documentation purpose and is used in the GO database naming convention.

### Auto-computed genomesize and STAR index from reference FASTA

**Decision**: `genomesize` (MACS2 `-g` effective genome size) and `star_index` (`--genomeSAindexNbases`) are computed automatically from the reference FASTA by a `compute_genome_stats` rule in `environment_setup.smk`. The rule produces `genomes/{ref_genome}/genome_stats.json` containing total bases, N bases, effective size, and STAR SA index nbases. Consumer rules (MACS2 peak calling, STAR index building) read the computed values from the JSON file at execution time. User-provided values in the options file take precedence (override check in shell blocks via params).

**Formulas**:
- `genomesize` = total bases − hard-masked (N/n) bases. This is appropriate for MACS2 `-g`, which needs the effective (non-N) genome size. Softmasked (lowercase) bases are NOT subtracted: they represent mappable repeats and should be included in the effective size.
- `star_index` = `min(14, floor(log2(totalBases) / 2 - 1))` per the STAR manual recommendation.

**Rationale**: Both values are fully derivable from the reference FASTA. Requiring users to specify them manually was error-prone (the S. pombe test case had an incorrect `star_index` of 11 instead of the correct 10) and created an unnecessary barrier for adding new genomes. The override mechanism preserves backward compatibility and allows expert users to tune values.

**Design**: The stats are computed in a dedicated rule (not a params lambda) because Snakemake params lambdas run at DAG time before execution, so they cannot read files produced by other rules on a fresh run. The `genome_stats.json` file is added as an input to consumer rules, ensuring proper dependency ordering. The shell block checks for a config override first (via a params lambda using `.get()`), falling back to the JSON file read only when no override is provided.

**Alternatives considered**: (1) Computing uniquely-mappable-regions for genomesize. Rejected because it is computationally heavyweight, read-length-dependent, and provides only marginal benefit for MACS2 peak calling. (2) Computing in a Python script imported at DAG time. Rejected because it would require the FASTA to exist before DAG resolution, breaking clean builds. (3) Using a checkpoint rule. Rejected as unnecessarily complex; a standard rule with input dependencies achieves the same effect.

### Auto-resolved NCBI TaxId and auto-derived GO database name

**Decision**: The NCBI TaxId (`ncbi_taxid`, renamed from `ncbiID`) is auto-resolved at pipeline runtime from genus+species using `ncbi-datasets-cli`. The GO database name is auto-derived as `org.<G><species>_<GenomeName>.eg.db` (e.g. `org.Athaliana_ColCEN.eg.db`). Both the `ncbi_taxid` and `go_database` config fields are no longer required — `ncbi_taxid` can be set as an optional override, and `go_database` is removed entirely.

**Rationale**: Both values are fully derivable from genus, species, and genome name. Requiring users to look up TaxIds manually and construct GO database names was error-prone and created unnecessary data entry. The genome-name suffix in the GO database name prevents collisions when multiple reference genomes share the same binomial (e.g. two maize assemblies). The `resolve_taxid` rule follows the same pattern as `compute_genome_stats`: produce a JSON file consumed as input by downstream rules, with user-provided values taking precedence.

**Design**: A new `resolve_taxid` rule in `environment_setup.smk` produces `genomes/{ref_genome}/taxid.json`. When `ncbi_taxid` is set in config (and is not `<auto>`), the override is written directly. Otherwise, `datasets summary taxonomy taxon "{genus} {species}"` is called. If the lookup fails, the JSON contains `null` and a warning is emitted — dependent analysis (GO) will fail at the R script stage with a clear error. The `create_GO_database` rule reads the TaxId from the JSON file at execution time.

**Alternatives considered**: (1) Looking up TaxId at DAG time via a params lambda calling `subprocess`. Rejected for the same reason as genome stats — it would require network access during DAG resolution and fail on air-gapped nodes. (2) Keeping `go_database` as an optional override. Rejected because no use case was identified for a user-specified name that deviates from the convention, and removing it simplifies the config surface.

### Auto-derived GTF from GFF via gffread

**Decision**: When `gtf_file` is omitted or set to `<auto>` in the genome config, the `check_gtf` rule automatically derives the GTF from the GFF using `gffread -T`. User-provided GTF paths continue to work as overrides. `gtf_file` is no longer a required field in startup validation.

**Rationale**: The GTF is only consumed by STAR indexing (`make_STAR_indices`), and is fully derivable from the GFF annotation that users must already provide. Requiring both files was a common source of setup friction — users had to manually run `gffread` before starting the pipeline. Since the conversion is deterministic and fast, auto-deriving it follows the same pattern as `genomesize`, `star_index`, and `ncbi_taxid`: compute by default, allow override.

**Design**: The `check_gtf` rule takes the GFF as an input (creating a dependency on `check_gff`), reads the `gtf_file` config value via `.get('gtf_file', '<auto>')`, and branches: user-provided paths are validated and copied/decompressed as before; `<auto>` triggers `gffread -T`. An empty-output guard catches GFF files that gffread cannot convert (e.g. non-standard GFF formats) and directs users to supply a GTF explicitly. `gffread` (bioconda) was added to the `epibutton.yaml` conda environment.

**Alternatives considered**: (1) Using a checkpoint rule. Rejected as unnecessary — a standard rule with an input dependency on the GFF achieves the same ordering. (2) Running gffread unconditionally and ignoring user GTF files. Rejected because some users have curated GTF files with modifications not present in their GFF (e.g. additional transcript annotations).
